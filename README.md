There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I chose FIFA 19 complete player dataset.

As a football fan, it would be quite interesting to apply data analysis skills here.

My key interests would be:

1.  What's the ratio of total wages/ total potential for clubs. Which clubs are the most economical ï¼Ÿ
2.  How is nation team player total market value distributed? Probably show a distribution plot in a world map?
3.  How is a player's skilsl set influence his potential/wage? Can we predict a player's potential based on his skills' set?

Data.csv contains lastest edition FIFA 2019 players attributes including age, potential, wage, etc.

There is also a notebook available here to showcsae all my work related to my three questions.

The main findings of the code can be found at the  [post](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/download-a-csv-file-from-a-kernel)  available

Must give credit to Udacity courses for some of code ideas, and to kaggle/AirBnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available  [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=images&sxsrf=ALeKk01EzMI4URoOk4y_oV52up1lp_3OHg:1618564865803&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiI1Pz-t4LwAhWzoekKHcwzDrcQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1280&bih=553#imgrc=wp1tdfttzeGYZM). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
